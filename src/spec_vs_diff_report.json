  "summary": "Implemented a new /about route and added an \"About Us\" link in the site header navigation. Added a home-only bottom RKS contact block via a new HomeRksContactBlock component rendered on the home page. However, the diff summary for AboutPage.tsx is truncated before showing the full Terms & Policy completion and the required Help Desk / Contact details, so those REQ-43 acceptance criteria are not verifiably implemented from the provided evidence. Several unrelated admin/product hooks and components also appear modified per the diff summary, which were not requested.",
