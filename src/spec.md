# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a new public English “About Us” page for DailyKart and show an RKS contact block at the bottom of the Home page.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new public route at `/about` with an English “About Us” page describing DailyKart as a local online ordering platform (not a direct seller), operating under RKS Brand, serving Vrindavan (and nearby areas), and including Terms & Policy sections plus a Help Desk / Contact Us section.
- Add an “About Us” link to the existing site header navigation (desktop and mobile) without changing other navigation items.
- Add a Home-page-only bottom section (on `/` only) displaying: Brand Name (RKS), Address (Vrindavan, Rukmani Vihar, Sector-2), and Contact Number (9897743469), styled consistently and mobile-friendly.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open an “About Us” page from the header to read DailyKart details, policies, and contact info, and they will also see RKS brand/address/contact details in a dedicated bottom block on the Home page.
